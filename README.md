Social Media is a very vast platform that is the source of the thoughts and the happenings. People post the disasterous things happening in their life over social media using captions to explain the situation. These social media post particularly over tweeter are very useful to these disasters to the authorities. The main task in front of the authorities is to classify real tweets and the fake ones. This is very important task of segregating the figurative langauges of the content uploaded on the social media with the real contextual data and information.
